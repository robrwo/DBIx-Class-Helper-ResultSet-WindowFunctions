# NAME

DBIx::Class::Helper::WindowFunctions - Add support for window functions and aggregate filters to DBIx::Class

# VERSION

version v0.7.0

# SYNOPSIS

In a resultset:

```perl
package MyApp::Schema::ResultSet::Wobbles;

use base qw/DBIx::Class::ResultSet/;

__PACKAGE__->load_components( qw/
    Helper::WindowFunctions
/);
```

Using the resultset:

```perl
my $rs = $schema->resultset('Wobbles')->search_rs(
  undef,
  {
    '+select' => {
        avg     => 'fingers',
        -filter => { hats => { '>', 1 } },
        -over   => {
            partition_by => 'hats',
            order_by     => 'age',
        },
    },
    '+as' => 'avg',
  }
);
```

# DESCRIPTION

This helper adds rudimentary support for window functions and aggregate filters to
[DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx%3A%3AClass) resultsets.

It adds the following keys to the resultset attributes:

## -over

This is used for window functions, e.g. the following adds a row number columns

```perl
'+select' => {
    row_number => [],
    -over => {
       partition_by => 'class',
       order_by     => 'score',
    },
},
```

which is equivalent to the SQL

```
ROW_NUMBER() OVER ( PARTITION BY class ORDER BY score )
```

You can omit either the `partition_by` or `order_by` clauses.

## -filter

This is used for filtering aggregate functions or window functions, e.g. the following clause

```perl
'+select' => {
    count     => \ 1,
    -filter => { kittens => { '<', 10 } },
},
```

is equivalent to the SQL

```
COUNT(1) FILTER ( WHERE kittens < 10 )
```

You can apply filters to window functions, e.g.

```perl
'+select' => {
    row_number => [],
    -filter => { class => { -like => 'A%' } },
    -over => {
       partition_by => 'class',
       order_by     => 'score',
    },
},
```

which is equivalent to the SQL

```
ROW_NUMBER() FILTER ( WHERE class like 'A%' ) OVER ( PARTITION BY class ORDER BY score )
```

The `-filter` feature was added v0.6.0.

# CAVEATS

This module is experimental.

Not all databases support window functions.

# SUPPORT FOR OLDER PERL VERSIONS

Since v0.7.0, the this module requires Perl v5.20 or later.

Future releases may only support Perl versions released in the last ten years.
